The key slots used in the CellChat object are described below.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{data.raw}}{raw count data matrix}

\item{\code{data}}{normalized data matrix for CellChat analysis (Genes should be in rows and cells in columns)}

\item{\code{data.signaling}}{a subset of normalized matrix only containing signaling genes}

\item{\code{data.scale}}{scaled data matrix}

\item{\code{data.project}}{projected data}

\item{\code{images}}{a list of information of spatial transcriptomics data}

\item{\code{net}}{a three-dimensional array P (K×K×N), where K is the number of cell groups and N is the number of ligand-receptor pairs. Each row of P indicates the communication probability originating from the sender cell group to other cell groups.}

\item{\code{netP}}{a three-dimensional array representing cel-cell communication networks on a signaling pathway level}

\item{\code{DB}}{ligand-receptor interaction database used in the analysis (a subset of CellChatDB)}

\item{\code{LR}}{a list of information related with ligand-receptor pairs}

\item{\code{meta}}{data frame storing the information associated with each cell}

\item{\code{idents}}{a factor defining the cell identity used for all analysis. It becomes a list for a merged CellChat object}

\item{\code{var.features}}{A list: one element is a vector consisting of the identified over-expressed signaling genes; one element is a data frame returned from the differential expression analysis}

\item{\code{dr}}{List of the reduced 2D coordinates, one per method, e.g., umap/tsne/dm}

\item{\code{options}}{List of miscellaneous data, such as parameters used throughout analysis, and a indicator whether the CellChat object is a single or merged}
